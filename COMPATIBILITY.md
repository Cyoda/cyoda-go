# Compatibility

Cross-repo version compatibility for the cyoda-go ecosystem.

The ecosystem has five independent SemVer axes, each tracking a different stability promise to a different audience. This file declares the supported combinations.

## The five axes

| Axis | What it tracks | Bumps when | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`cyoda-go` binary** `v<X.Y.Z>` | The shipped EDBMS application | Each user-facing release | End users (Homebrew, downloads, Docker) |
| **`cyoda-go-spi`** `v<X.Y.Z>` | The stable plugin contract surface | The SPI Go interface changes | Storage-plugin authors (in-tree + out-of-tree) |
| **`cyoda-go/plugins/<x>`** `v<X.Y.Z>` | Each in-tree plugin's exported API | The plugin module's exported Go API changes | Out-of-tree plugin authors (test fixtures) |
| **Chart `version:`** | Helm chart's manifest output | Templates / values / schema change | Helm operators |
| **Chart `appVersion:`** | Default binary the chart ships | Each binary release worth advertising via the chart | Helm operators |

Coupled by the dependency direction:

```
cyoda-go-spi   ←   cyoda-go   ←   cyoda-go-cassandra (out-of-tree)
                       ↓
                   plugins/{memory,sqlite,postgres}
                       ↓
                   deploy/helm/cyoda  (chart)
                       ↓
                   homebrew-cyoda-go  (formula, auto-synced by GoReleaser)
```

## Compatibility matrix — `cyoda-go` × `cyoda-go-spi`

| `cyoda-go` | Root `go.mod` pins | In-tree plugin go.mods pin | SPI surface added in this release |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`v0.8.0`** | `cyoda-go-spi v0.8.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.8.0` | Transaction-state sentinel hierarchy: `ErrTxNotFound`, `ErrSavepointNotFound`, `ErrTxTerminated`, `ErrTxRolledBack`, `ErrTxAlreadyCommitted`, `ErrTxCommitInProgress`, `ErrTxTenantMismatch`; grouped-stats optional capabilities: `Iterable` (`Iterate`, `Iterator`, `IterateOptions`, `Filter`) and `GroupedAggregator` (`GroupedAggregate`, `GroupedAggregationOptions`, `ErrAggregationNotPushdownable`); scheduled-transition shape: `TransitionDefinition.Schedule *TransitionSchedule` (`DelayMs`, `TimeoutMs *int64`); async-result shape: `ProcessorConfig.AsyncResult *bool`, `ProcessorConfig.CrossoverToAsyncMs *int64`; client-owned annotations: `Annotations json.RawMessage` on the workflow, state, and transition definitions |
| **`v0.7.1`** | `cyoda-go-spi v0.7.1` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.7.1` | — (pin-sync correction; no new SPI surface) |
| **`v0.7.0`** | `cyoda-go-spi v0.7.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.1`† | `ProcessorConfig.StartNewTxOnDispatch *bool` |
| `v0.6.3` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | — (binary-only changes) |
| `v0.6.2` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | — |
| `v0.6.1` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | — |
| `v0.6.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | `cyoda-go-spi v0.6.0` | `ExtendSchema` retry + ctx-cancellation contract |

† The in-tree plugin submodules pin `spi v0.6.1` rather than `v0.7.0` because they don't use `StartNewTxOnDispatch`. SPI is strictly additive — `v0.7.0` is fully backward-compatible with `v0.6.1` consumers.

### Out-of-tree plugin authors

A plugin pinned to **`cyoda-go-spi v<X.Y.Z>`** is compatible with any **`cyoda-go v<A.B.C>`** whose root `go.mod` pins the same `v<X.Y>.*` series or any *later* `v<X+1.0.0>` series that hasn't broken the interfaces the plugin uses.

In practice, today: **all SPI versions `v0.5.0` … `v0.8.0` are mutually source-compatible** (additive changes only). Plugins on any of these versions build and run correctly against `cyoda-go v0.7.x` and `v0.8.0`. This will change only when SPI introduces a breaking interface (none planned for v0.x).

### Migration window

cyoda-go's root `go.mod` may pin a **newer** SPI version than out-of-tree plugins are using. Consumers compose at runtime — the active plugin's pinned SPI version determines which SPI surface is actually exercised, and unused additions are inert. There is no requirement that the binary's SPI pin and the plugin's SPI pin match exactly.

### v0.8.0 milestone — SPI pseudo-version pin window (closed)

During the v0.8.0 development milestone, the root `go.mod` and every in-tree plugin submodule pinned a pseudo-version of `cyoda-go-spi` against `main` HEAD while the SPI surface was still settling. That window closed at release: `cyoda-go-spi v0.8.0` was tagged and all four manifests were bumped to the release tag (the `v0.8.0` matrix row above). An earlier `v0.8.0` SPI tag was cut prematurely and retracted; the re-cut tag is canonical — out-of-tree consumers that fetched the premature tag should refresh.

### Optional capability interfaces (grouped-stats)

The `Iterable` and `GroupedAggregator` SPI interfaces are **type-assertion-only**. The `EntityStore` base interface is unchanged. Existing plugins keep compiling without implementing either. A plugin that implements neither causes `POST /api/entity/stats/{entityName}/{modelVersion}/query` to return 501 `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_BY_BACKEND`; every other endpoint continues to work normally. Implementing only `Iterable` is sufficient — the service layer falls back to streaming-tally when `GroupedAggregator` is absent. Implementing `GroupedAggregator` without `Iterable` is supported but loses the in-transaction code path (in-tx calls route through `Iterable` to preserve read-your-writes).

## Plugin tag history

| Plugin module | Latest tag | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| `cyoda-go/plugins/memory` | `v0.7.1` | Memory backend (test + reference) |
| `cyoda-go/plugins/sqlite` | `v0.7.1` | SQLite backend (single-node, embedded) |
| `cyoda-go/plugins/postgres` | `v0.7.1` | PostgreSQL backend (production multi-node) |

These rarely move because each plugin's *exported* Go API (factory constructors, package-level helpers) is stable. Internal changes ride along with `cyoda-go` binary releases without a submodule tag bump. Out-of-tree consumers (e.g. cyoda-go-cassandra's parity test fixtures) pin pseudo-versions resolving to specific cyoda-go commits.

## Out-of-tree plugins

| Plugin | Latest tag | Pins `cyoda-go` | Pins `cyoda-go-spi` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cyoda-go-cassandra` | `v0.1.1` | `v0.6.3-0.20260427233530-f7bc7ee68c60` (pre-#27 pseudo-version) | `v0.6.0` | Implementation-current at v0.6.x; v0.7.0 parity-scenario adoption pending next dependency bump |

When cyoda-go-cassandra bumps to `cyoda-go v0.7.0`, the four new parity scenarios from #229 + #230 (`transactionWindow` chunking, per-item ifMatch isolation, chunk-rollback, paired `STATE_MACHINE_START` + `TRANSITION_ABORTED` audit) automatically run against the Cassandra backend via `e2e/parity/registry.go`. The plugin must implement the optional `parity.TxBoundAuditFixture` interface (returning `true`) to pass the audit-pairing scenario.

## Helm chart × binary

| Chart `version:` | Chart `appVersion:` | Default binary | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.7.0` | `0.7.1` | `cyoda-go v0.7.1` | **Current.** Adds optional `migrate.postgres` DSN — a separate migration-Job (owner/DDL) role for the two-role DB model; backward-compatible (falls back to `postgres.existingSecret`). First chart-manifest change since `0.6.3`. |
| `0.6.3` | `0.7.0` | `cyoda-go v0.7.0` | Chart manifests unchanged since `cyoda-0.6.3`; `appVersion` advances independently per [PR #232](https://github.com/cyoda/cyoda-go/pull/232). |
| `0.6.3` | `0.6.3` | `cyoda-go v0.6.3` | Tagged as `cyoda-0.6.3` chart release (April 2026). |

The chart's `version:` bumps only when **rendered manifests** change (templates, values, schema). The chart's `appVersion:` advances each binary release worth advertising via the chart. The two are decoupled by Helm convention.

### Operator action required

| Upgrading binary from → to | Chart action | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| Any `v0.6.x` → `v0.7.0` | None (chart manifests unchanged) | If fronting a browser SPA: set `extraEnv` `CYODA_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-spa.example.com`. New CORS middleware defaults to loopback-only. See [`cmd/cyoda/help/content/config/cors.md`](./cmd/cyoda/help/content/config/cors.md). |
| Any `v0.6.x` → `v0.7.0` | None | Wire-format breaking changes per [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md#070--2026-05-05): `messaging.GetMessage` content shape; stub `errorCode` rename; OpenAPI spec reconciliation. Affects API/SDK clients, not the deployment manifests. |

## Homebrew formula

[`homebrew-cyoda-go`](https://github.com/cyoda/homebrew-cyoda-go) ships a single binary per release. The `cyoda.rb` formula is auto-updated by GoReleaser on every `v*` tag push and pins:

- `version "<X.Y.Z>"` (matches the binary tag)
- `url "…/cyoda_<X.Y.Z>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz"`
- `sha256 "…"` per platform

End users always get a coherent install — the formula's `version` IS the binary's version. There is no separate compatibility concern at this layer.

## Reading this matrix

- **End user installing or upgrading the binary**: care about the binary version only. Use Homebrew, the GitHub Release archives, or the Helm chart with `appVersion`.
- **Helm operator**: care about chart `version:` for upgrades and `appVersion:` for which binary you're deploying. Read the "Operator action required" table when bumping `appVersion:`.
- **Out-of-tree plugin author**: pin `cyoda-go-spi` at the version whose surface you use. The matrix tells you which `cyoda-go` binary versions ship a compatible engine.
- **Downstream Go-module consumer**: the binary's pinned SPI version is whichever the root `go.mod` declares for that release. The plugin submodule pins are independent — they apply only if you're consuming a submodule directly.

## Maintaining this file

Update on every cyoda-go binary release **and** on every cyoda-go-spi tag. The release-manager workflow in [`MAINTAINING.md`](./MAINTAINING.md) includes this file in the release checklist.

When the SPI introduces a breaking interface change (not planned in v0.x), add a "Breaking" row to the matrix and document the migration path in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).
